# Roles
The plan for roles was aimed like this:
| Role | Reason |
|------|--------|
| 0    | Kind of like a guest with an account; maybe used as a means of temporary suspension |
| 10   | Curator (default); can curate most pages |
| 100  | Admin; can do pretty much anything except modify system pages |
| 500  | System administrator or system bots; exclusive to one account unless manually configured |
